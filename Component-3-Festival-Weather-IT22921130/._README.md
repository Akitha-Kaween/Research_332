# AI Tour Planner (IT22921130)

## Overview
This research module implements an **Intelligent Multi-Objective Tour Planner** that goes beyond simple distance minimization. It uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimal route for a tourist visiting multiple attractions in Kandy, considering:
1.  Real-world Directions:Using OpenStreetMap data via `osmnx`.
2.  Weather Constraints: Avoiding outdoor locations during high rain probability hours.
3.  Crowd Avoidance: Minimizing visits to congested areas during peak times.

### Dataset
*   File: `sri_lanka_chat_data.json`
*   Size: ~12,000 records
*   Content: Detailed Q&A about Hotels, Landmarks, Food, and Itineraries for 10 districts.

## Methodology

### 1. Graph Construction
We fetch the drivable street network of **Kandy, Sri Lanka** using `osmnx`. This provides a realistic graph $G=(V, E)$ where edges represent actual roads and weights represent lengths.

### 2. Distance Matrix
We calculate the shortest path distance between all pairs of 6 key attractions (Temple of the Tooth, Kandy Lake, Peradeniya Gardens, etc.) using Dijkstra's algorithm on the road network.

### 3. Genetic Algorithm
We evolve a population of routes using:
*   Representation: Permutation of location indices.
*   Fitness Function: $F = \frac{1}{TotalDistance + WeatherPenalty + CrowdPenalty}$
*   Selection: Tournament Selection.
*   Crossover: Ordered Crossover (OX1).
*   Mutation: Swap Mutation.

## Results
The algorithm produces an optimized sequence of visits (e.g., "Temple -> Lake -> Museum -> Gardens"). The final output is an interactive map (`minimal_tour_map.html`) displaying the route path in green and markers for each stop.
